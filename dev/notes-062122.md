# Dev Notes 6/21/22
Note
When creating a change log on the wiki page I would like to suggest that we label the updates with a tag
Ex:
Security Patch's will start with SP followed by the date and then a dash and then a number for each line item ie [SP062022-1] etc....
Website updates will follow the same format ex [WU06212022]
FiveM Change logs [VM062022]
RedM Change Logs [RM062022]
